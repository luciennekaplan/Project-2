# Project-2
Blake Ashford, Lucy Kaplan, Savannah Cordry

Since we will soon complete the University of Oregon Data & Analytics Bootcamp, we would like to investigate options for employment across the country. 

### The Primary Question
As a data scientist, what factors need to be considered when job searching? 
  1. Location: Where are the most jobs available?
  2. Salary: What jobs pay the most?
  3. What industries have the most available data science jobs?
  4. Title: How are these variables affected by job title (Data Analyst vs. Business Analyst)?

## The Method
We will take data provided by Kaggle in CSV format, clean it, and then import it into a Postgres database. From there, we'll be able to put the data onto a website for users to easily access the data through maps and graphs.
