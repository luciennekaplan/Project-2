# Project-2
Blake Ashford, Lucy Kaplan, Savannah Cordry

Since we will soon complete the University of Oregon Data & Analytics Bootcamp, we would like to investigate options for employment across the country. 

### The Primary Question
Where in the US are the most available jobs with the highest income?

## The Method
We will take data provided by Kaggle in CSV format, clean it, and then import it into a Postgres database. From there, we'll be able to put the data onto a website for users to easily access the data through maps and graphs.
